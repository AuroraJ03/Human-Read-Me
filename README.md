# Human-Read-Me

## **Hello World.** :joy: My name is 蒋周洋 and my English name is Aurora, which I named myself when I was 10. 
### I was produced in 1st of March, 2003, at Shenzhen, China. Upgraded in New Zealand for 8 years, after 11 years in China. 
### I think the bug in my life is that I can' t get up bed over the weekend.
### Graduated from IB, I am currently studying graphic communication design and I hope I will advance my study in interaction design for the next few years.
